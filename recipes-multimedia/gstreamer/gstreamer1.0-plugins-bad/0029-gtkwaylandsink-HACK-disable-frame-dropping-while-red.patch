Subject: [PATCH 2/2] gtkwaylandsink: HACK: disable frame dropping while redraw
 is pending

This workaround is needed to reach 30fps video playback.

Redraw callback is received late, leading to many frames
being dropped and so low framerate on display driver stage.
The fact that redraw callback is received late is not yet understood
but display subsystem is able to sustain a higher framerate
than the one reached with redraw callback mechanism.
This workaround consists to ignore redraw callback allowing to
get back to the expected framerate performances.

Even if not observed yet, there is a risk of visible decoding artefacts
due to the fact that downstream elements could rewrite in a frame
being currently rendered by display subsystem...
